# Signal_Processing_Algorithms

I have implemented three signal-processing algorithms to analyze Audio and Image features:
1. PCA - Principal Component Analysis
2. ICA - Independent Component Analysis
3. NMF - Non-negative Matrix Factorization

First, I analyze an audio that contains the sound of 3 instruments. We see how 3 algorithms try to interpret/detect the sounds of those instruments in the audio.

Next, I apply the same algorithms to the MNIST image dataset to observe what the algorithms learn at each stage in the computation and how they perceive the similarities and differences in the signals.
